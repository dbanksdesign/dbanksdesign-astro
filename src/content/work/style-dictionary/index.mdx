The Style Dictionary framework was created out of a pain point discovered in the Seller Mobile team: style information like colors and sizes that were meant to be shared across platforms were written in platform-specific code and spread across many codebases. This made it difficult and error-prone to update any styles of the mobile application. The goal of Style Dictionary was to address that issue in a generic way so that any team, and eventually any company could use because this problem is not specific to the Seller Mobile team.

> Style Dictionary has certainly been helpful for our team as it's given us a framework to start with in terms of how to think about distributing the source of truth for our design tokens to many different platforms


> I think Style Dictionary has been one o the most impactful tools we have adopted in Cosmos. It's been transformational for our design system, that supports multiple products (among them, Badoo and Bumble. It has has had a incredible impact in not only how I work, but also the native teams (Android/iOS) and the front-end teams (mobile/desktop) work. And we're still at the very beginning, just discovering the full potential of it. I don't think this would have been possible with other tools (eg. Theo) because of the way they were built. I think Style Dictionary is such a great tool because it reflects the personal qualities of its creator: simple - so accessible to every one - but very powerful and effective - so with a big positive impact on everyone
